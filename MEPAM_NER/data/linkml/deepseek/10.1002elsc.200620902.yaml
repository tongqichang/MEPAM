  hydrogen transfer employing overexpressed ADH-'A' from Rhodococcus ruber DSM 44541
  in Escherichia coli\tThe alcohol dehydrogenase ADH-??A?ˉ from Rhodococcus ruber
  DSM 44541 represents a highly efficient catalyst for biocatalytic hydrogen transfer
  reactions. Starting from an exceedingly low level of active ADH-??A?ˉ in Escherichia
  coli, the apparent specific activity of ADH-??A?ˉ overexpressed in E. coli cells
  could be drastically enhanced by a factor of 550 by optimizing the host and induction/growth
  conditions. The influence of reaction parameters like pH, cosubstrate (2-propanol,
  acetone) concentration, substrate concentration temperature and additional cofactor
  on the apparent activity was investigated. In contrast to the purified enzyme, the
  pH optimum for oxidation and reduction were identical. Due to the employment of
  whole cells of E. coli/ADH-??A?ˉ as catalyst lower operational stability was found.\t
  3.1 Cultivation Starting from two E. coli clones,namely, E.coliBL21(DE3)/pET22b+-ADH-'A?ˉ('E.
  coliBL21?ˉ)and E. coliD.H5a/pUC18-ADH-'A?ˉ('E. coli DHSa')15], the cultivation of
  these strains wasoptimized in shake flasks to achieve amaximum of activity per dry
  cell weight.As an assay the reduction of acetophe-none in the presence of 2-propanol
  ashydrogen donor was performed. Further-more, for all assays lyophilized cells wereemployed.
  Starting from the standard cultivation procedureaccording to the literature, such
  as incubation for threehours before induction by IPTG (0.4 or 1 mM) and conti-nuation
  of cultivation for one to 24 hours at 30??C, revealedthat ADH-'A?ˉ was expressed
  in an active form as a first posi-tive result. However, the activity of lyophilized
  cells of E. co-li BL21 thus obtained was low (see Tab. 1); the results for E.coliDHSa
  were similar (data not shown). Overall, apparentactivities of E. coliBL2l were rather
  disappointing as thebest E. coli preparation still displayed only one fourth of
  theactivity of wild-type cells (~ 0.0057 U/mg CDW).Due to the low ODs4g obtained
  after 24 hours of inductiontime during the first cultivation (see Tab. 1), the incubationtime
  prior to induction was extended during the next optimi-zation round. Subsequently,
  the IPTG concentration wasvaried between 1 and 2 mM, With these sequential varia-tions
  the specific activity compared to the wild type doubled(see Tab. 2).Although the
  incubation time after inductionshowed no significant influence, the highest activity
  was ob-tained after an incubation periodof 22 hours in the presence of2 mM IPTG.
  By using SDS-pageit was found that a significantamount of inclusion bodies wereformed.
  Therefore, in the next step, thecultivation temperature after induction was varied
  between 25and 30??C.Furthermore, sinceADH-'A?ˉis a zinc-dependent en-Zyme, additional
  zinc was supplied to the culture medium(100 mg/L ZnClz).Althoughhigher ODs were
  obtained whencultivated at 30??C, higher specif.ic activity was obtained at 25??C(see
  Tab. 3). At this stage, the EcoliBL21(DE3)clone alreadyshowed double activity comparedto
  E.coliDHa (data notshown).Nevertheless, inclusionbodies were still present, although
  their relative amount haddecreased as judged by SDSpage.Subsequently,the cultivation
  temperature after inductionwas lowered to 20??C.Since the pElsystem wasidentified
  as the one leading tohigher apparent specific activity,various other E. coli(DE3)
  hostswere tested(see Tab.4).Comparing the results obtained for E.coliBL21(DE3)at
  20??C(seeTab.4)with those obtained at25 'C(see Tab. 3), a fourfold improvement was
  found. Host Ecoli Tuner(DE3)showed alsopromising high activity. UponSDS-page analysis,
  almost no in-clusion bodies were detected.By leaving the cultivation con-ditions
  identical(except for thecultivation time after induction.48 and 100 hours)it was
  foundthat an induction time beyond48 hours was not beneficial(seeTab. 5). Finally,
  an increase in apparentspecific activity was obtained bylowering the incubation
  temperature prior to induction for allexcept for E.coliBL21(DE3)(see Tab. 6, first
  four entries). Since SDS-page analy-sis confirmed that a significant amount of ADH-'A?ˉwaspresent,
  it was envisaged that a shortage of cofactor mightbe limiting.Consequently, when
  NADH was added to theassay, a further fivefold increase was indeed observed for
  theapparent specific activity. In summary, best results were obtained using the
  host Ecoli Tuner (DE3), reaching an apparent activity of 2.0 U/mgcells under optimized
  reaction conditions for the reductionof acetophenone with simultaneous recycling
  of the cofacto1at the expense of 2-propanol. For comparison, employingwild-type
  cells, mere 0.006-0.03 U/mg cells were obtained.Overall, this corresponds to a 550-fold
  improvement. 3.2 Reaction Parameters A crucial parameter in hydrogen transfer reactions
  is toemploy a high concentration of the cosubstrate, i.e., 2-propa.nol (for reduction),
  which has two roles: on the one hand, itshifts the redox equilibrium towards the
  product side and.on the other hand, it increases the concentration of the substrate
  in the aqueous phase by acting as solubilizer. SinceADH'A?ˉ can also be employed
  in the reverse direction. i.e..the hydrogen transfer oxidation of sec-alcohols employingacetone
  as cosubstrate(see Scheme 2), both redox modeswere tested. The results from the
  optimization of ADH activity in hydrogen transfer reactions by variation of cultiva-tion
  conditions as described above in carbonyl reduction andalcohol oxidation were identical.3.2.1
  Cosolvent Concentration It has been noted before that partially purified ADH-'Acan
  withstand 2-propanol at concentrations up to 50 % v/v inwhole resting cells of the
  wild-type strain [11], and up to80 % v/v in partially purified form [12]. However,
  ADH'Acloned into E. coli cells was expected to be less sturdy sincethe latter whole-cell
  system would already collapse at lowerconcentrations of 2-propanol or acetone. Indeed,
  high ADHactivity was observed only until 16 % v/v 2-propanol or ace-tone before
  the apparent specific activity significantly de-creased(see Fig.1).Nevertheless,
  ADH-activity was stillmeasurable at 60 % y/y of cosubstrate concentration.3.2.2
  Temperature As previously observed, native ADH-'A?ˉ is active even upto 65 'C [12];
  again, the E. coli/ADH-'A?ˉ collapsed at lowertemperature, namely, just above 40??C
  (see Fig. 2), which canagain be attributed to the less stable E. coli host. For
  curiosity,the hydrogen-transfer system was tested at low temperatures,i.e., below
  0'C using 16 % v/v of cosubstrate. At -12??C theaqueous-organic system was still
  liquid and, surprisingly, theenzyme was still active without significant loss of
  activitywhich could be exploited for the transformation of chemicallylabile ketones/alcohols
  at low temperature.3.2.3 Cofactor Concentration As mentioned above in the cultivation
  study, the additionof cofactor to the reaction mixture had a significant influ.ence
  on the apparent activity. The most obvious increase inactivity was found within
  the range of 0 and 1 mM cofactor.with an optimum at 2 mM cofactor concentration.
  However.further increase to 3 mM did not lead to further enhancement of activity(see
  Fig. 3). 3.2.4 Substrate Concentration The maximum tolerable substrate concentration
  was mea-sured by keeping the cosubstrate concentration at a constantlevel of 15
  % v/v(acetone/2-propanol). The relative activityfor the oxidation of rac-1-phenylethanol
  remained approxi.mately constant within experimental error. For the reductionof
  acetophenone, however, a linear increase in activity up to1 M of substrate was observed.
  3.2.5 Dependency on pH In contrast to ADH'A?ˉin whole wild-type cells, whichshowed
  a broad pH optimum between pH 7.0 and 12.0 forthe oxidation as well as for the reduction
  [16], purifiedADH-'A?ˉshowed two distinctive pH optima for the reduc-tion (pH 6.5)and
  oxidation (pH 9)[12]. Similar to whole-cell transformations using the wild type,
  the pH graphs forE. coli/ADH-'A' for the reduction and oxidation showed thesame
  shape and were almost parallel (see Fig. 5), however,the optima were very sharp
  at pH 7.5. By serendipity, the ac-tivity was also tested at pH <5 and, surprisingly,
  activity wasfound within this pH range. The loss of activity at pH ~ 5.2fits very
  well with the pI of ADH-'A?ˉ at ~ 5.1."
