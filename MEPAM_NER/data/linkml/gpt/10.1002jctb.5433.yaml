input_text: "Enhanced heterologous expression of Trichoderma reesei Cel5A/Cel6A in
  Pichia pastoris with extracellular co-expression of Vitreoscilla hemoglobin\tBACKGROUND
  The deficiency of family 5 endoglucanase (Cel5A) and family 6 cellobiohydrolase
  (Cel6A) has become a key limiting factor on cellulase enzymatic hydrolysis in bioprocessing
  of cellulosic biomass. To improve the production of Trichoderma reesei Cel5A / Cel6A,
  a Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) gene was tried to co-express extracellularly for
  the first time with Cel5A / Cel6A in Pichia pastoris GS115.  RESULTS Newly constructed
  recombinant of co-expressing Cel5A / Cel6A extracellularly with VHb was consistent
  with the single expression at some key variables of culture condition, i.e. inoculum
  size, initial pH, culture temperature and methanol concentration. Comparing their
  single expression, the CMCase activity of co-expressed Cel5A and Cel6A enzymes enhanced
  by 40% and 30%, respectively. With high-cell-density fed-batch (HCDFB) fermentation,
  the co-expressed Cel5A enzyme activity was 366.8?U mL-1 with 4.3?g L-1 protein content
  and the Cel6A enzyme activity reached 1.3?U mL-1 with 2.23?g L-1 protein content.
  The two co-expressed enzyme activities were enhanced by 35% and 20%, respectively,
  compared with the single expression.  CONCLUSION VHb protein capable of binding
  oxygen can be successfully co-expressed extracellularly with other target proteins.
  The co-expression of VHb with recombinant Cel5A / Cel6A is efficient at improving
  oxygen-limited condition and thus enzyme production in both shake-flask and HCDFB
  fermentation. ? 2017 Society of Chemical Industry\tOxygen supply is one paramount
  parameter for cell growth and heterologous protein expression in recombinant P.
  pastoris. The high O2 trapping and releasing ability makes VHb a suitable protein
  to be co-expressed in P. pastoris to meet the intensively high O2 demand in the
  methanol induction phase of HCDFB fermentation.19, 20 Therefore, to enhance P. pastoris
  cell performance including growth, viability, and heterologous protein production,
  we attempted to construct a recombinant P. pastoris strain capable of extracellular
  co-expression of VHb and Cel5A / Cel6A under the control of the AOX1 promoter in
  the next experiment.  Construction of co-expression recombinants The VHb gene was
  cloned in the vector pPICZ|áA to obtain Zeocin resistance. The constructed expression
  vector containing VHb gene was examined with agarose gel electrophoresis after single/double
  restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. S1, Supporting data).  The above linearized chimeric
  DNA genes pPICZ|áA-vgb was transformed into the two recombinants P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A
  and P. pastoris GS115-Cel6A, respectively. With preliminary screening on the YPDS
  plate (500?|ìg mL-1 Zeocin) (Fig. S2) and repeat screening in shake flask (Fig.
  1), Colony-69 and Colony-15 promised growth and CMCase activity, and were thus selected
  as the co-expression strain, named as P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb and P. pastoris
  GS115-Cel6A?+?vgb, respectively.Verification of the co-expression recombinants Colony
  PCR analysis was performed (Fig. 2). It is shown that the fragments of Cel5A / Cel6A
  and vgb were separated via agarose gel electrophoresis. The pPICZ|áA plasmid carrying
  vgb was introduced individually in the recombinants P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A and
  P. pastoris GS115-Cel6A, and finally formed into the co-expressed recombinants.Furthermore,
  CO-difference spectra were measured to verify the functional expression of VHb in
  two recombinants. The two expression recombinants P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A / -Cel6A
  and two co-expression recombinants P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb / Cel6A?+?vgb were
  all incubated at 30???C for 144?h to compare the absorption spectra of their broth
  supernatant. As shown in Fig. 3, there was no absorption peak for the broth supernatant
  of the recombinants P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A / -Cel6A. Remarkably, an intense absorption
  peak at 419?nm appeared for the broth supernatant of P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb.
  In addition, a strong absorption peak at 408?nm and a deep trough near 436?nm were
  observed for P. pastoris GS115-Cel6A?+?vgb. The spectra meant that the vgb gene
  product expressed from the AOX1 promoter in the two co-expression recombinants had
  significant biochemical activity, binding the carbon monoxide. This observation
  is in accordance with the earlier study by Wu and Fu.22 Briefly, these results indicated
  that VHb was successfully co-expressed extracellularly with recombinant Cel5A /
  Cel6A enzyme. Furthermore, the co-expressed VHb presented superior performance for
  binding oxygen as expected.Preliminary fermentation optimization for two co-expression
  recombinants Finding the optimal cultivation condition is indispensable for recombinant
  protein expression.26-28 To obtain a high expression level of the recombinant Cel5A
  and Cel6A, several key variables of the strain cultivation, i.e. inoculum size,
  initial pH, culture temperature and methanol concentration, were considered.  Figure
  4 demonstrates the effect of these key variables on cell biomass and Cel5A enzyme
  production of P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb. The results showed that 2% of the inoculum
  size contributed to both the maximum cell biomass (OD600?=?27.1) and Cel5A enzyme
  activity (26.9?U mL-1 at 144?h) (Fig. 4(A)). At an initial pH?5.0, both the cell
  biomass and enzyme production reached a maximum level after 144?h of fermentation
  (Fig. 4(B)). At 28???C, the recombinant maximized cell biomass at OD600?=?25.6 and
  enzyme activity at 25.8?U mL-1 (Fig. 4(C)). 1.5% (v/v) of the methanol addition
  showed higher CMCase activity and OD value, and was chosen for future experiments
  (Fig. 4(D)). Thus, the incubation of P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb was optimized
  as follows: inoculum size 2%, initial pH?5.0, culture temperature 28???C and methanol
  addition 1.5% (v/v). Similarly, the growth condition of P. pastoris GS115-Cel6A?+?vgb
  was selected as below: inoculum size 3%, initial pH?7.0, culture temperature 26???C
  and methanol concentration 1.5% (v/v) (Fig. 5). This indicated that the optimal
  conditions (i.e. the initial pH) for the two recombinants were different from each
  other to promote high enzyme production. Presumably, the target gene variety of
  Cel5A/Cel6A enzyme was responsible for the difference. However, the optimal incubation
  condition was consistent with that of the corresponding single expression reported
  previously.15, 16 It suggested that VHb gene insertion in the recombinant did not
  change the culture condition of recombinants.Under these selected conditions, P.
  pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb produced 28.0?U mL-1 of Cel5A enzyme with biomass OD600
  of 27, and P. pastoris GS115-Cel6A?+?vgb yielded 0.17?U mL-1 of Cel6A enzyme with
  biomass OD600 of 23. This indicated that VHb enhanced the Cel5A / Cel6A enzyme expression
  and resulted in 1.4¨C1.3-fold enzyme activity compared with that of their respective
  predecessor (20?U mL-1/0.13?U mL-1). In short, VHb introduction can effectively
  improve the expression with no influence on the incubation condition of the recombinants.23\
  \  HCDFB fermentation of two co-expression recombinants Numerous references in the
  literature have demonstrated that the preferred culture for high cell density growth
  should contribute to protein yields.10 Based on the above shake-flask fermentation,
  the HCDFB fermentation of two co-expression recombinants was implemented in a 5?L
  fermenter to assess the role of VHb by characterization of their growth and enzyme
  production (Fig. 6). Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a key parameter for high cell density
  fermentation and should be kept above a minimum level.29 In this study, DO was controlled
  at approximately 20%, and the addition of carbon source was coupled with the DO
  to facilitate good growth of recombinants (Fig. 6(a) and (b)). During the period
  of fermentation, the cell biomass of the two recombinants increased rapidly. Both
  P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb and P. pastoris GS115-Cel6A?+?vgb yielded an almost
  maximum cell biomass of OD600?=?785 and OD600?=?683, respectively, at 180?h of fermentation.
  The results showed that the growth of the two strains was exceedingly robust and
  suitable for HCDFB fermentation.Figure 6(c) and (d) describe the expression profile
  of Cel5A and Cel6A enzymes from the two recombinants. With the HCDFB fermentation
  approach, the two recombinants produced more enzymes. SDS-PAGE of fermentation supernatant
  indicated that the Cel5A and Cel6A protein content increased with fermentation time.
  For P. pastoris GS115-Cel5A?+?vgb, the protein concentration and enzyme activity
  were maximized at 4.3?g L-1 and 369?U mL-1 at 180?h, respectively. Recombinant P.
  pastoris GS115-Cel6A?+?vgb produced a high protein concentration and enzyme activity
  with fermentation time ongoing. At 204?h, the protein concentration and enzyme activity
  was 2.2?g L-1 and 1.3?U mL-1, respectively. These results indicated that the two
  recombinants are capable of high heterologous enzyme expression during HCDFB fermentation.\
  \  Previous work on heterologous Cel5A / Cel6A enzyme expression in P. pastoris
  has been reported. As seen in Table 1, the highest CMCase activity of Cel5A enzyme
  was 2358.8?U mL-1 with 2.6?g L-1 of protein content by optimization of Cel5A gene.12
  And the highest Cel6A enzyme activity reached 9.1?U mL-1 with 5.9?g L-1 of protein
  content in P. pastoris.11 Our work is the first to co-express the cellulase Cel5A
  / Cel6A extracellularly with VHb in P. pastoris to improve their respective heterologous
  secretion. Based on these studies, the Cel5A / Cel6A enzyme expression obtained
  in this study is of a high level.Compared with the shake-flask fermentation, the
  co-expressed Cel5A enzyme activity in HCDFB fermentation increased by 13 times,
  and the cell biomass (OD600) 29-fold. Likewise, the Cel6A enzyme activity in HCDFB
  fermentation was eight times that of the former (0.17?U mL-1) with a 30-fold increase
  of cell biomass. Accordingly, HCDFB fermentation is an effective way to yield high
  heterologous enzyme. Further, the specific CMCase activity of co-expressed Cel5A
  and Cel6A enzymes in HCDFB fermentation was 467?U (L OD600)-1 and 1.9?U (L OD600)-1,
  respectively, against 1037?U (L OD600)-1 and 7.4?U (L OD600)-1 of the enzymes in
  the corresponding shake-flask fermentation (Table 1). The data support our recent
  argument that the growth associated product formation kinetics cannot guarantee
  consistency in the values of YP/X, even though the same expression system is used.30
  More efforts are needed to improve the specific enzyme activity of cell biomass
  in future work.  Compared with the single expression recombinants, the cell biomass
  of co-expressing Cel5A and Cel6A recombinants increased by 14% and 15%, respectively,
  in HCDFB fermentation (Table 1). Though almost equivalent in protein production,
  the Cel5A enzyme activity from the co-expression recombinant was 369.0?U mL-1 of
  CMCase activity, which was 37% higher than that (270.9?U mL-1) of the single expression
  recombinant. Likewise, co-expressing Cel6A recombinant produced 20% more enzyme
  activity than that (1.08?U mL-1) of the single expression recombinant. The comparison
  suggests that the introduction of VHb gene enhanced both cell biomass and enzyme
  production in HCDFB fermentation. Thus, VHb gene is indeed efficient in improving
  the oxygen-limited condition of these strains.  In shake-flask fermentation, the
  VHb co-expression had either no positive (Cel5A) and even adverse (Cel6A) effects
  on cell biomass compared with the single expression (Table 1), which has been observed
  in other research.31 Conversely, several researchers stated that the VHb+ strain
  displayed excellent cell growth with a high cell density.21-23 In this case, there
  is a dispute over the role of co-expressed VHb on the cell biomass with shake-flask
  fermentation, although it is unanimous that there was a positive influence on enzyme
  production. Further, the VHb co-expression allowed production of 1037?U (L OD600)-1
  of the specific Cel5A enzyme activity and 7.4?U (L OD600)-1 the specific Cel6A enzyme
  activity in shake-flask fermentation, which was enhanced by 45% and 85% compared
  with their corresponding single expression systems. Similarly, Wu et al.31 reported
  that the specific |?-galactosidase activity of the VHb+ strain increased approximately
  3-fold higher than that of the VHb? strain. However, Wu and Fu22 found that the
  enhancement of |?-galactosidase activity was exclusively due to the increase in
  cell biomass of the VHb?+?strain, arguing that no obvious increase of the specific
  |?-galactosidase activity was contributed by VHb co-expression. These arguments
  also seem contradictory. Interestingly, our result for VHb co-expression with Cel5A
  and Cel6A in HCDFB fermentation separately supported their bilateral argument, as
  the specific Cel5A enzyme activity (467?U (L OD600)-1) was enhanced by 19% and the
  specific Cel6A enzyme activity (1.9?U (L OD600)-1) remained almost equivalent compared
  with their respective single expression. Wang et al.21 speculated that the function
  of VHb might vary in different microorganisms. Undisputedly, DO control of the fermentation
  process can contribute to the dispute as VHb is supposed to present the active role
  under the aeration-limiting condition. In addition, the VHb is likely to change
  the metabolism pathway of microbial cells depending partly on medium composition.34
  The reason underlying the apparently contradictory argument has yet to be elucidated."
